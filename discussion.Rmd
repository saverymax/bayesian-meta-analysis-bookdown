\section{Discussion}

We have discussed Bayesian methods for estimating random-effects models in meta-analysis. In particular, we have focused on the effect of prior information when estimating the between-study variance. We discussed both informative and weakly informative priors, and took care to describe some theoretical results regarding weakly informative priors. We then conducted a Bayesian meta-analysis of our own, using studies on the effect of ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19. We documented somewhat inconclusive findings. One reason for this may be the fact that the studies included in our meta-analysis are highly heterogenous in their effect, with quite different within-study variances. When allowing for posterior uncertainty in Bayesian inference, the heterogeneous effects increase the uncertainty in our estimates. 

We conclude with the following: This meta-analysis was conducted on summary data of ivermectin studies.  We did not, however, use individual patient data. \cite{Lawrence-2021} cautions against this, simply because there has been an relatively high level of scientific misconduct regarding ivermectin studies. Access to the patient level data would prevent this to some extent. A meta-analysis is only as good as the data that goes in. All the advantages of the Bayesian methods are useless, if the summary data can hardly be considered reliable.
